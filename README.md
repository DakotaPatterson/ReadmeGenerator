# ReadMe Generator

  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description
  This project is a Readme Generator that uses the user input to generate a readme using node.js. My motivation was to make an application that allowed users to create a readme for any project that they are working on and have it auto filled for them. This application allows the user to input all the inofrmation about their project using node.js and then a file is saved under the readme.md file. I have learned that node.js is useful to help users and developers to have a more streamlined development experience.

## Installation
To install this application you just need to clone the repository to your local machine where you can then run node index.js in the terminal, this will then prompt the inquirer package to run the prompts and create a readme with your answers.


## Usage
The best way to use this application is to have it saved on your local machine and then you can run this to generate any readme you may need for a future project.

## Tests
This can be tested once the application has been copied on your local machine. You can run the prompt using node index.js and proceed to answer the questions with any answer you like. One test is to try empty strings for answers and make sure the terminal prompts you to answer the question again.
